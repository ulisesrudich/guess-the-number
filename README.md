# 🔢 Guess The Number - Mini Game (Portfolio Project)

Simple game built with **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** to practice basic **programming logic** and **DOM manipulation**.  
A random number between 1 and 20 is generated, and the player must guess the number.  
If the player doesn't guess the right number a hint is displayed on screen (higher/lower).  
If the player guesses correctly the game ends, having the option to play again and also view the highscore.
